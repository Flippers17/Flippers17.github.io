        This was made during my second ever game jam that I participated in, this time with 3 other people and, again, 48 hours to make it. The theme was “Fall” which in our interpretation was reflected in that the goal of the game was to make a bunch of people fall off a building… by pushing them. This time around, I had a lot more sleep and felt much more well rested than last time, although this led to me spending less time working on the game. In the end, that didn’t affect the results that much and, besides the horrible balancing, it didn’t feel like there was something crucial that we didn’t have time to finish before the deadline.

        The game is about making your way up a building using some platforming, while also pushing enemies off the building. The pushing mechanic is a set of different quick time mechanics, either about timing a mouse click or about clicking fast. For the pushing mechanic, I made an easy to use tool too be able to give the different enemies different settings for the quick time events, such as speed, beginning and end of the green zone and what type of event it is.
