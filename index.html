                This is a student project I did together with 11 other people in the course Spelprojekt 2 (Game project 2), where the focus was mostly just on making a fun game in order to improve your skills. 
                The hook of this game was that your shots would fire in sync with the music and also add another track of sounds to the music when fired. 
                My biggest role in this project was the programming of this feature, and so I worked closely with the musician of our team. 
                From this project, I learned alot about the tool FMOD, used for implementing sounds and/or music in game engines like Unity, since we needed this sort of tool in order to make this kind of game. 
                Working with this many people on one project was also a new experience, from which i learnt alot. 
                This is probably also the biggest project I have worked on so far, at least in scope and resources, concidering we were 12 people, although we only got about 8 weeks to work on it.
