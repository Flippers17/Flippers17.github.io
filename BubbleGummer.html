                    This game was made for Global Game Jam 2025, where the theme was “bubble”. During this jam, I worked with 6 other people and together we made a movement shooter where your goal is to survive hordes of enemies while using your bubbles to bounce around and gain speed. A lot of the focus was spent on the movement of the player character, which I think turned out great, although the other parts of the game were not as interesting. Unfortunately, the enemies weren’t very interesting and were way too hard, and the movement wasn’t really put to use properly.

                    As mentioned though, I think that the movement turned out great and I spent most of the time available during the game jam on it, and making a more complete experience around this movement is something I might do in the future.
