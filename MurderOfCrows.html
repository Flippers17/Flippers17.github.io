        <p>
            I did this project alone, so all the code was done by me. I did use some 3rd-party assets for some graphics (player character with animation, enemy character with animation, a texture for walls and floors) and one sound (a wing flapping sound for the birds). This project was worked on for about 3 weeks. It was done for a course in University with the prupouse of learning about different AI-technologies in video games. For this project I focused on steering behaviours. In the game, the player controls a character in 3D-space with simple 3D-movement, but also controls a flock of birds that they can use to attack, solve puzzles and block attacks. The movement of the birds were made with these steering behaviours previously mentioned.

        <h2>Steering behaviour (BOIDS)</h2>
        <p>
            This was my first time properly developing my own steering behaviour, although I had worked with steering behaviours made by another programmer before. 
            In this case, I did some research on the BOIDS-algorithm, which worked well, since it was birds I was simulating. Most of the sources I found discussed it in a 2-dimensional space, but I was working in a 3-dimensional space, which meant I had to make some adjustments. In most cases, it was just a matter of vector math, which meant there was not much to adjust at all besides performing calculations with 3-dimensional vectors. When it came to obstacle avoidance on the other hand, the problem was a bit more complicated, but I found a solution that would generate a number of evenly distributed points on a sphere, then raycast towards those points to see if any obstacles were in the way. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The different behaviours that were used to create a composite behaviour was separation, cohesion, alignment, target bias and obstacle avoidance. Each behaviour had a weight to it, but also had a force multiplier that would multiply the final output of the individual behaviours. These numbers were altered and tweaked constantly throughout the project, but I think I managed to get some good numbers for the feel I was going for.
        </p>

        <h2>Optimization of the BOIDS</h2>
        <p>
            Like for Disco Demolition Knight, I made some optimizations for the neighbour search part of the algorithm, which in this case I used Octrees for. In this case it was not as necessary, since using Unityâ€™s built in physics overlapping functions gave good enough performance, but it was something I was interested in and wanted to try out. Since it was in 3D, doing something more like what I did in Disco Demolition Knight where I divided the tree into partitions beforehand, would be much less effective, since the amount of space was bigger, and the amount of nodes would increase in a cubical manner. 
        </p>
        <p>
            With the octree I had control over what datatype I would store. This was a big benefit, since there were a bunch of different variables that was needed for the calculations, and since I am using an object oriented development environment, each BOIDS-agent could have an instance of a class on it with the information needed, and the octree could store said class. This made working with and expanding the BOIDS-algorithm much easier.
        </p>
