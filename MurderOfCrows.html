                    I did this project alone, so all the code was done by me, but I did use some 3rd-party assets for some graphics. This project was worked on for about 3 weeks. For this project I focused on learning about steering behaviours. In the game, the player controls a character in 3D-space with simple 3D-movement, but also controls a flock of birds that they can use to attack, solve puzzles and block attacks. The movement of the birds were made with these steering behaviours previously mentioned.

                <h2>Steering behaviour (BOIDS)</h2>
                <p>
                    This was my first time properly developing my own steering behaviour, although I had worked with steering behaviours made by another programmer before. 
                    When it came to obstacle avoidance, it was a bit complicated to do in 3D, but I found a solution that would generate a number of evenly distributed points on a sphere, then raycast towards those points to see if any obstacles were in the way. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    The different behaviours that were used to create a composite behaviour was separation, cohesion, alignment, target bias and obstacle avoidance. Each behaviour had a weight to it, but also had a force multiplier that would multiply the final output of the individual behaviours. These numbers were altered and tweaked constantly throughout the project, but I think I managed to get some good numbers for the feel I was going for.

                <h2>Optimization of the BOIDS</h2>
                <p>
                    Like for Disco Demolition Knight, I made some optimizations for the neighbour search part of the algorithm, which in this case I used Octrees for. In this case it was not as necessary, since using Unityâ€™s built in physics overlapping functions gave good enough performance, but it was something I was interested in and wanted to try out. Since it was in 3D, doing something more like what I did in Disco Demolition Knight where I divided the tree into partitions beforehand, would be much less effective, since the amount of space was bigger, and the amount of nodes would increase in a cubical manner.
